def pick_channels_mne(ch_names, include, exclude=[], ordered=False):
    """Pick channels by names.
    Returns the indices of ``ch_names`` in ``include`` but not in ``exclude``.
    Taken from https://github.com/mne-tools/mne-python/blob/master/mne/io/pick.py

    Parameters
    ----------
    ch_names : list of str
        List of channels.
    include : list of str
        List of channels to include (if empty include all available).
        .. note:: This is to be treated as a set. The order of this list
           is not used or maintained in ``sel``.
    exclude : list of str
        List of channels to exclude (if empty do not exclude any channel).
        Defaults to [].
    ordered : bool
        If true (default False), treat ``include`` as an ordered list
        rather than a set, and any channels from ``include`` are missing
        in ``ch_names`` an error will be raised.
        .. versionadded:: 0.18
    Returns
    -------
    sel : array of int
        Indices of good channels.
